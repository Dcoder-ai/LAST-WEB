<p>”The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.”- Socrates
Capturing the Crowning Glory, setting off #2021 with a bang, bench marking our skills, in the face of adversity, the resilient educators of the school made a choice – “We can be bitter, or we can be better. Those words were our North Star.” Keeping this in mind, 42 teachers successfully qualified as Microsoft Certified Educators. The Microsoft Certified Educator Program is a professional development program that bridges the gap between technology skills and innovative teaching. Educators holding a Microsoft Certified Educator certification validates that they have the skills needed to provide rich, custom learning experiences for their students that incorporate critical 21st century skills using Microsoft tools.</p>
